# Dynamic-Pricing-for-Payment-Processing-Fees
This pipeline creates a dynamic pricing model for payment processing fees based on merchant risk profiles, transaction volumes, and fraud likelihood. It uses regression and optimization techniques to maximize revenue while managing risk.


Pipeline Steps:

Data Collection: Use synthetic or proprietary merchant transaction data with features like transaction volume, merchant type, and fraud history.
Data Preprocessing: Clean data, encode categorical variables, and normalize numerical features.
EDA: Analyze relationships between merchant risk, transaction volume, and pricing outcomes.
Feature Engineering: Create features like average transaction size, fraud rate, and merchant credit score.
Model Development: Train a regression model (e.g., CatBoost) to predict optimal pricing, with constraints for risk.
Model Evaluation: Use RMSE and MAE to evaluate pricing accuracy, and simulate revenue impact.
Model Deployment: Deploy as a FastAPI service for real-time pricing recommendations.
Monitoring: Track pricing performance and adjust for market changes.


Key Notes:

Dataset: Synthetic data is used here, but real-world merchant data (e.g., from Stripe or Square) would include transaction volumes, fraud rates, and merchant types.
Optimization: CatBoost handles categorical features well and optimizes pricing predictions. Constraints can be added for risk thresholds.
Evaluation: RMSE and MAE measure pricing accuracy, with revenue simulation ensuring business alignment.
Deployment: FastAPI enables real-time pricing adjustments, suitable for payment platforms.
